# Verde Valley Virus

The [Yavapai County Community Health Services website](https://www.yavapai.us/chs) provides an excellent breakdown of Yavapai County cases and their locations, tests, hospitilization, and further details.

The one caveat is that the website only shows the current set of numbers, and there is no way to look back at days prior or compare the trends in the information. Upon contacting the webmaster for historical data, I was presented with the response below:

> Thank you for visiting the Yavapai County Government website.  We're sorry to hear that you're not finding the information you need.  We donâ€™t currently keep a history of all the numbers on our website.  The history of news items can be found here: https://www.yavapai.us/chs/News, and _some_ of the counts are available in the attached press releases, but not _all_ counts.  We recommend that you call the Yavapai County Emergency Phone Bank for COVID-19 (928-442-5103) or YCCHS (928-771-3134, email: web.Health@yavapai.us) for more information.  Have a great day.

I believe that this data could be extremely helpful to anyone in our area, especially amid the headlines around Arizona and the rapid spread of the virus. In reality, our cities in the Verde Valley are making great efforts to curb the spread of the virus, and my hope is that the data presented here helps alleviate fears and reinforce the community working together to curb the spread.
